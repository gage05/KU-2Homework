# <KU-Homework2>

## Description

My motivation behind this project was that I wanted to become more proficient at HTML and CSS whilst also building something I will use in the future. I built this project because having an impressive portfolio is very important for getting a job as a software engineer. This project is that portfolio and with this new portfolio i can work to increase how good I look to potential employers. Through this project, I have learned how important media queries can be and how CSS is the backbone of most web applications.
